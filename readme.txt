Description:
- what does this do?
- when will it be "complete"?
     - basically, what features need to be complete for me to say "it's done"?


To do:
- github integration and initial commit
- make dropbox ignore git files to avoid file bloat in Dropbox
- find a weather service that has a public, free API I can access and request info from
     -further requirements are that I'd like to request it only with a zip code as my provided info
- make the HTML skeleton to test basic functions while developing
     -make an empty div and some sub-elements and place it in a good spot so that i have a place
     to populate information into
     -make a button that, for now, populates the ^elements with info; this will be the button that
     eventually causes the weather info to be fetched and populated into the div to be displayed.
- draw out how the program's flow will work on my whiteboard and attach a picture of that to this directory
- figure out what license I need, if any. My intent currently, on hour 0, is to not use anything
that I'm not allowed to use, and to have my code be open source and fully usable by any and all who
wish to use it - although I will not be designing this project specifically for public use; it is a
novice's project and definitely has many superior alternatives, although I am making it to train myself
to be a professional who works in the field of software dev.


Plans:
- tools required and used:
     -html, js, css
     -Atom text editor
     -Github and atom-integrated git for version control
     -Dropbox for file backup in case something goes wrong with github

Estimated time required:
As of hour 0, I'm estimating that this project will take me between 10 and 20 hours to complete.



Wishlist:
- this section will be for ideas that I'd like to add but are not core to the project



 Miscellaneous notes:
- make sure not to use any libraries or tools that are not open source licenses or ones that
don't grant me permission to use them!


Post-mortem documentation:
- how long did it actually take? If my estimation was off, why?
- What was hardest about this project, so that I may re-visit those topics to better learn them?
- what was easy? Why?
- record your successes and failures, as well as frustrations here for self-transparency
